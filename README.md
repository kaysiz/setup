# FAQ

## I get a permissions error. Why?

You may need to update your local libraries directory. 

```
sudo chown -R $(whoami):admin /Library/Caches/Homebrew
sudo chown -R $(whoami):admin /opt/homebrew-cask/
sudo chown -R $(whoami):admin /usr/local/
```

## I get failure errors. Why?

You have to install Xcode developer tools

```
xcode-select --install
```

## But I don't want \<application> installed. 

Just remove \<application> from https://github.com/ombulabs/setup/blob/master/mac.sh
